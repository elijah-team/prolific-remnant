# Undertow Common Code
Ideally these would be placed in `stubbornjava-undertow` however we don't want to introduce additional dependencies there. Maybe in the future we will break this out into a sub project per library for example `stubbornjava-undertow-metrics`

A good example showcasing some of these classes can be found in the post on [Middleware](https://www.stubbornjava.com/posts/logging-gzip-blocking-exception-handling-metrics-middleware-chaining-in-undertow)
